# LoRaWAN Handover Roaming 
LoRaWAN Handover Roaming is novel LoRaWAN roaming scheme to enable inter-operatorroaming based on DNS resolution and end-device context migration between networks. In this work, Our contributions are threefold :

* Design and implementation of a LoRaWAN architecture extension to handle inter-operators roaming capability.
* End-devices lookup DNS-based resolution using JoinEUI codification.
* Real Deployment roaming testbed

# LoRaWAN Architecture Extension
We extended the LoRaWAN standard architedture with two main components as illustrated in the following figure.

* MA
* LA
